# Pentest-Enumeration-Script

Enumeration:
This script makes use of different enumeration tools such as masscan, nmap, Dirsearch, and Nikto. It automates the process of initial enumeration by taking IP address as the input. It uses masscan to scan for all TCP and UDP open ports. This information is sent to nmap to make service and script scans on the open ports. All the gathered information is then parsed for services which are used to automatically run relevent nmap scripts on that particular IP address. Nmap script scans are performed for smtp, ms-sql, smb, ssh, ssl and http services. For websites that run on http as well as https, multi threading is used so that Dirsearch and Nikto scans can be run at the same time on both (http and https), which saves a lot of time. 

Port Forwarding and Pivoting:
In this section, Local Port Forwarding and Dynamic Port Forwarding have been implemented which can be used to pivot to different subnets within the exploited network. Another option is to use the tool sshuttle for a VPN-like connection. Another section has been created for pivoting over multiple machines using SSH. Double pivot using sshuttle will be added in the future.

Pre-requisites:
- python3
- masscan
- dirsearch (add dirsearch to PATH env variable)

Usage: python3 EnumScript.py

Future implementation consists of:
1. Automated Metasploit module lookups based on nmap output.
2. Gobuster as an alternative to dirsearch- Faster directory bruteforce.
