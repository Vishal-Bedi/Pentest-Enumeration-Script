# Pentest-Enumeration-Script

This script makes use of different enumeration tools such as NMAP, Dirb, Nikto, etc and automates the process of enumeration by taking a single input of IP address.

It makes use of the nmap output and automatically runs relevent nmap scripts for the port found. 

Future implementation consists of:
1. Masscan - faster port detection.
2. Automated Metasploit lookup based on nmap output.
3. Gobuster - faster directory bruteforce.
