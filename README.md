# Pentest-Enumeration-Script

This script makes use of different enumeration tools such as nmap, Dirb, Nikto, etc and automates the process of initial enumeration by taking IP address as the input. It parses the nmap output for services and ports which are used to automatically run relevent nmap scripts on that particular IP address. It includes nmap script scans for smtp, ms-sql, smb, ssh, ssl and http. For websites that run on http as well as https, multi threading is used for running Dirb and Nikto scans on both which saves a lot of time.

Usage: python3 EnumScript.py

Future implementation consists of:
1. Masscan - faster port detection.
2. Automated Metasploit lookup based on nmap output.
3. Gobuster - faster directory bruteforce.
